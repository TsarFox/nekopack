## Software programmed and maintained by [Jakob.](http://jakob.space/)
Nekopack is a work-in-progress attempt at reverse engineering the archive format used by Nekopara.

Please use this software responsibly. I chose to develop and release this because I see it as a very valuable teaching tool in accompaniment to my writeup, and I think that people who legally purchased Nekopara should have the right to view the game's content. I do not condone piracy or the redistribution of copyrighted materials in any way, shape, or form.
