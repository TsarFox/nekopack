========
## Software programmed and maintained by [Jakob.](http://jakob.space/)
Nekopack is a work-in-progress attempt at reverse engineering the archive format used by Nekopara.

Please use this software responsibly. I chose to develop and release this because I see it as a very valuable teaching tool in accompaniment to my writeup, and I think that people who legally purchased Nekopara should have the right to view the game's content. I do not condone piracy or the redistribution of copyrighted materials in any way, shape, or form.

Nekopack is free software, licensed under the [GNU General Public License.](http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)


Compilation
-----------
Nekopack can be compiled by running `make` from the repository's root directory.

The binary can be stripped with `make strip`.

* [The NEKO WORKs Team](http://nekopara.com/main.html) for developing this game. Reversing the archive format was a challenge that gave me a feeling of purpose when I needed it most.
* [Marcin Kurczewski](https://github.com/rr-) for his work on [Arc Unpacker](https://github.com/vn-tools/arc_unpacker), which I used as a reference when writing various section parsers.
* [SmilingWolf](https://bitbucket.org/SmilingWolf/) for finding and publishing the encryption keys used by Nekopara.
